== Description ==
Automatically insert some specific content into all of your posts at a specified position. Great for automatically adding a newsletter subscription widget. The position is declared in percentage and a simple algorithm tries to find a place between two block-elements (paragraph/list/div) that is closest to the declared one.

== Installation ==
After activating the plugin go to its settings page to specify the declared position and the content to use.
